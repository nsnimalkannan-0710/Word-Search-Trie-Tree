# Word-Search-Trie-Tree
Word-Search-Trie-Tree is a mini-project that demonstrates how the Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure can be used to efficiently store, search, and retrieve words. This project is designed to show how tries are applied in real-world applications such as dictionaries and word search engines
