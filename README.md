# Word-Search-Trie-Tree
Word-Search-Trie-Tree is a mini-project that demonstrates how the Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure can be used to efficiently store, search, and retrieve words. This project is designed to show how tries are applied in real-world applications such as dictionaries and word search engines

A Trie (also called a Prefix Tree) is a special tree-like data structure used to store strings efficiently.
Each node represents a character, and paths from the root form words.

Using a Trie:
    Searching a word is faster
    Prefix searching becomes very efficient
    Memory is optimized for large vocabularies

Programming Language: (Mention your language here – e.g., Python / Java / C++)
Data Structure: Trie (Prefix Tree)

How It Works
    Words are inserted into the Trie one character at a time.
    Each character becomes a node in the tree.
    Searching is done by traversing the tree based on input characters.
    If all characters match, the word or prefix exists in the Trie.
